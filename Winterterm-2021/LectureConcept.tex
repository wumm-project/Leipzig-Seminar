\subsection{General}

The lecture will take place synchronously online (Thursdays 11-13 am.) and is
based on the Flipped Classroom concept. The lecture consists of three parts.

In the first part we explore the concept of a \emph{technical system} and
introduce the main concepts of TRIZ as the most important systematic
innovation methodology.  In contrast to other creativity and innovation
methodologies, TRIZ focuses on the systematisation of engineering experiences.

In the second part, we study more closely aspects of the creation of
conceptual networks for data models on the basis of the \emph{Resource
  Description Frameworks} (RDF), the \emph{Linked Open Data Cloud}, the
emerging \emph{Giant Global Graph} and the importance of these developments
for the organisation of contexts of cooperative action.

Finally, in the third part, we explore the role of data and information and
the generation of new language tools for the development of technical systems
in the context of a civil society and, in particular, the importance of
concept formation processes in cooperative action.

In addition to the general bibliography, each lecture will be accompanied by
literature for preparation which should be \textbf{studied before the
  lecture}, in order to be able to follow the explanations. In the lecture the
topics are presented only cursorily, but there is room to ask questions about
the literature and to discuss individual aspects.

Most of the material is available in the public folder \texttt{Material} in
the github repository \emph{Leipzig-Seminar}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
or is otherwise easily found on the internet. Nevertheless we will not
dispense on classical printed literature and your ability to access it.

To support our opening for an international audience, we switch step by step
to English as operational language. Since most of the materials used so far
are in German, the lecture will take place in a mixed form, with English
presentation and slides, but mostly referencing to German-language literature
for self-study.

The progress of the lecture will be reported regularly in the folder
\texttt{Winterterm-2021} of the above mentioned github repository. There you
will also find the schedule and the slides of the individual lectures.

\subsection{Digital Privacy}

We follow not only a theoretical but also a practical Open Culture approach
and make course materials publicly available.  This also applies to the
(annotated) chat recordings of the lecture, in which your names are mentioned.
We assume your consent to this procedure, if you do not explicitly object.
The discussions themselves will \textbf{not} be recorded.
