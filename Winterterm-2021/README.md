# Winter Term 2021

* lecture: th/do 11:15-12:45

## Conception

The seminar is part of the advanced master module "Modelling of Sustainable
Systems and Semantic Web", which also includes a lecture and an online lab
with the TRIZ trainer of Target Invention.

The conceptual basis of the lecture and seminar is a _systemic approach to
descriptive structures_ that are significant in the real world. As an
instrument of complexity reduction, the _system concept_ is based on a set of
viable components whose interaction in the given systemic context produces the
_specific emergent functionality_. An aeroplane consists of several components,
none of them can fly, only the specific interaction of the parts produces the
new function.

This understanding of systems, which is also closely related to the topic of
Component Software in computer science, has many facets. In such systems, not
only the _structure_ but also their _processing_ plays an important role. Such
aspects - a systemically based management concept - were in the focus of the
seminar last semester. It turned out that most management theories assume an
appropriately authorised individual leader as the decision-making authority
and make his or her actions the object of investigation. This is
unsatisfactory, as management processes in multi-stakeholder systems with
distributed and rather consensus-oriented decision-making structures become
increasingly important. Such structures can be observed above all in
socio-ecological contexts and are thus central to the processing of
sustainability issues. Often, parts of such structuring processes can also be
described as phenomena of _systemic self-organisation_.

A more detailed study of such management phenomena is in the focus of the
seminar topics this semester.

## Potential 

Another important focus of the course is thinking, analysing and resolving
contradictions. Thinking in terms of contradictions and modelling (initially)
contradictory situations is a fundamental engineering competence, its teaching
in the context of a "General Theory of Strong Thinking" (OTSM-TRIZ) and its
further development as the "Innovative Design Method" (IDM) is at the centre
of our teaching programme.

> In order to be universal, the rules of problem solving methods should be as

> However, the more specific they are the less universal they are as well.

> Any problem can be stated as a contradiction between our subjective desires

## Data protection

We follow an Open Culture approach not only theoretically but also practically
and make course materials publicly available.  This also applies to the course
materials you have to produce (presentations, seminar papers) as well as to
(annotated) chat sessions of the seminar discussions, in which your names are
also mentioned.  We assume your consent to this procedure if you do not
explicitly object.  The discussions themselves are __not__ recorded, but the
chat protocols are published in an edited form.
