    \section{Introduction}

    \section{Aim of the work}

    The aim of this paper is to elaborate a proposal for an ontological modelling
    of the areas of \emph{TRIZ Flows} and \emph{TRIZ Flow Analysis} based on the
    materials of the TRIZ Ontology Project (TOP) of the TRIZ Developer Summit
    \cite{TOP} and further own investigations. The work fits into the activities
    of the \emph{WUMM Project} \cite{WUMM} to accompany the TOP project and to
    transfer it into the language of modern semantic concepts
    \cite{WUMM-Ontology}.  The work therefore consists of two parts -- a
    \emph{turtle file}, in which the semantic modelling is performed based on the
    SKOS framework \cite{SKOS}, and \emph{this elaboration}, in which the
    backgrounds and motivations of the concrete modelling decisions are detailed.

    \section{Starting point} 

    Flows and flow analysis play a rather peripheral role in TRIZ.  In the
    standard reference \cite{Petrov2007} on a \emph{TRIZ Body of Knowledge} is
    listed as item 2.5.8, but in the 7 references to the literature listed there
    are no systematic explanations about the role of flows in TRIZ theory, but
    only individual examples in which concrete flows (such as magnetic flow)
    played a role in concrete modelling.

    The most comprehensive source on issues of TRIZ modelling of flows and
    methodological issues of flow analysis is the thesis \cite{Lebedyev2015} by
    Yuri Lebedyev, which he submitted in 2015 under the supervision of S.A. 
    Logvinov for graduation as TRIZ Master. Since the thesis is only available in
    Russian, only the author's English summary was evaluated.

    Such a limitation is justified, since the aim of this seminar paper is not to
    completely cover the TRIZ theory of flow analysis, but only to identify its
    essential concepts and describe their connection with modern semantic RDF
    means based on the SKOS ontology. The basis for this is above all the
    presentation of Olga Eckardt in the webinar of the TOP project in October 2020
    \cite{Eckardt2020}, in which basic approaches of the Lebedyev's work have
    obviously been incorporated.

    We start from the definition of both concepts in the TOP Glossary
    \cite{TOP-Glossary}: 
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Flow} is the directional movement in space of particles of mass of
        matter, as well as the directional movement of energy or information. Flow
        has dual properties: the properties of a substance of which the flow
        consists, and the properties of a field, which is formed as a result of the
        directional movement of particles of matter. Flows can be useful, harmful
        and parasitic. The flow model contains static components: source, channel,
        receiver, control system. Flow is a special case of a process in which
        directional movement occurs in physical space.

        \textbf{Flow analysis} is a method of systems analysis to establish
        relationships in a system to flow, find resources, and determine compliance
        with existing system requirements. The result of a flow analysis is a model
        of the flow as is and a model of the flow to be. Flow modification
        techniques are used to develop systems with flows and to solve inventive
        problems in them.
    \end{quote}
    The use of these concepts is further included there in a single place in the
    context of cause-effect analysis (ibid.):
    \begin{quote}
        Cause-effect analysis is performed: 
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item When the causes of an undesirable effect are not clear (when we cannot
        go from an administrative contradiction to a technical one $AC\to TC$.
        \item When it is necessary to clarify the causes of an undesirable effect
        (to deepen the understanding of the causes of an undesirable effect, e.g.
        after a functional or a flow analysis).
    \end{itemize}
    \end{quote}
    Other sources are much more sparing in their statements on these two
    individual terms, but list other flow-related concepts, for example in
    \cite{Souchkov2018}:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item Delay Zone -- A location in a flow in which the integral flow speed is
        significantly lower than local flow speed. A Delay Zone is a typical
        disadvantage identified by Flow Analysis. 
        \item Flow -- A sequence of events that have the same common feature.
        \item  Flow Analysis-- An analytical method and a tool which identifies
        disadvantages in flows of energy, substances, and information in a technical
        system.
        \item  Flow Disadvantage -- A disadvantage of a technical system being
        analyzed identified during Flow Analysis. Examples: Bottlenecks, «Gray
        Zones», «Stagnation Zones», etc.
        \item Flow Distribution Analysis-- A part of Flow Analysis that identifies
        distribution of flows and their disadvantages. 
        \item Stagnation Zone -- A part of a flow in which the flow stops temporarily
        or permanently. A Stagnation Zone is a typical disadvantage identified by
        Flow Analysis.
        \item Transmission -- One of the key components (subsystems) of a Complete
        Technical System which according to the Law of System Completeness of a
        technical system transmits a flow of energy required to operate a working
        unit from an engine to the working unit.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{The Conceptualisations}

    The conceptualisations to be developed follow the basic assumptions and
    positings, that are elaborated in more detail in \cite{Graebe2021}. In
    particular, the following namespace prefixes are used:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \texttt{ex:} -- the namespace of a special system to be modelled. 
    \item \texttt{tc:} -- the namespace of the TRIZ concepts (RDF subjects).
    \item \texttt{od:} -- the namespace of WUMM's own concepts (RDF predicates,
    general concepts). 
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\texttt{tc:Flow}}

    A flow is a component within a system and hence modeled as subconcept of
    \texttt{od:Component}.  It has several properties that are modeled along the
    rules for a morphological table, i.e. defining a PropertyDomain and a list of
    allowed values as listed below.

    \HGG{Alle Subjekt-URIs beginnen mit einem Großbuchstaben.  Alle Subjekte
    sollten Singular sein, da eine Plural suggerierende Auflistung \texttt{A
        od:does B, C, D} in drei Drei-Wort-Sätze mit dreimal Singular aufgelöst
    wird.}

    As in Souchkov's Glossary we use URIs as 
    \begin{center}\tt
    tc:HarmfulAction, tc:HarmfulFunction, tc:HarmfulInteraction,
    tc:HarmfulMachine
    \end{center}
    that combine the property and the subject of the property except for
    \texttt{tc:FlowSubstance}.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
        Property & PropertyDomain \\\hline
        od:hasMode & tc:ModeValue \\
        od:hasFlowType & tc:FlowType  \\
        od:hasFlowSubstance & tc:FlowSubstance  \\
        od:hasFlowFunctionality & tc:FlowFunctionality  \\
        od:hasFlowDefect & tc:FlowDefect  \\
        od:hasFlowSource & tc:FlowSource  \\
        od:hasMethodOfDescription & tc:MethodOfDescription \\\hline 
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}\hline
        PropertyDomain & PropertyValues \\\hline
        tc:ModeValue & tc:System, tc:Model, tc:SystemAsIs, tc:SystemAsRequired,
        tc:ModelAsIs, tc:ModelAsRequired \\
        tc:FlowType & tc:ComplexFlow, tc:DiscreteFlow, tc:ContinuousFlow \\
        tc:FlowSubstance & tc:Information, tc:Energy, tc:Substance \\
        tc:FlowFunctionality & tc:UsefulFlow, tc:HarmfulFlow, tc:ParasiticFlow  \\
        tc:FlowDefect & tc:InsufficientFlow, tc:ExcessiveFlow,
        tc:BadControllableFlow, tc:AbsentFlow \\ 
        tc:FlowSource & tc:ExternalSource, tc:InternalSource  \\
        tc:MethodOfDescription & tc:TextDescription, tc:ParametricDescription,
        tc:GraphicDescription \\\hline 
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Subconcepts of \texttt{tc:Flow}}

    A flow consists of several parts (source, channel, receiver, control unit)
    that are components by their own and hence modeled with the predicate
    \texttt{od:subConceptOf}. For the moment they are attached to the flow with a
    single predicate \texttt{od:hasStaticFlowComponent}.

    \HGG{Ist es sinnvoll, mit Blick auf das Konzept eines „minimal arbeitsfähigen
    Flusses“, der alle Teile (source, channel, receiver, control unit) enthalten
    muss, hier das Prädikat weiter zu differenzieren?}

    \subsection{\texttt{tc:FlowAnalysis}}

    A flow analysis is an analytic process concerned with a certain \emph{flow}
    (model) in a certain context.  The \emph{context} encapsulates all information
    about the exact conditions of the analysis (Goals, Requirements, Description
    Method).

    The goal of a functional analysis is to create a plan for a flow
    transformation based on the \emph{flow analysis rules} that can be applied to
    the flow and improves it in the given context. Hence the target of a flow
    analysis is a special document in a (yet hypothetic) Flow Transformation
    Description Language.

    The ontological representation of such a process is extremely difficult and is
    not considered here. The ontology of the flow analysis is restricted to the
    description of the \emph{formative elements of the analysis} and the creation
    of a manually generated \emph{FlowTransformation} document.

    \HGG{Ich denke, diese Einschränkung sollte gemacht werden. Es wäre weiter zu
    klären, ob \texttt{od:hasDescriptionMethod} sowohl einen Fluss als auch eine
    Flussanalyse als \texttt{rdfs:domain} hat. In Ermangelung einer besseren Idee
    habe ich einer \texttt{tc:FlowTransformation} den Typ \texttt{foaf:Document}
    zugeordnet. }

    \section{Modelling the Flow Analysis Ontocard}
    \subsection{Preliminaries and context}
    This work is part of the WUMM\cite{WUMM} TOP Companion Project\cite{WUMMTOP}. 'One of the goals of the project is to transform that information[...]',
    which has been provided by the TOP,'[...]into RDF as the machine readable standard of the Web 3.0 (also called 'Semantic Web').'\cite{WUMMTOP}. Its 
    source code is managed in a git repository\cite{RDFData} and has been forked for developing the TRIZ Analysis Ontocard feature. The README manual
    of the repository provides necessary preliminaries for using and continue developing the project.
    
    few words to RDF in general + the reference sources    
    The Flow Analysis Ontocard
        - some notes referring to Eckardt
            - 
        - mentioning the Prerequisites
        The main part of the modelling workflow is the appropriate design how to translate the ontological structure of the given topic into the RDF scope
        of three-word-sentences. Therefore the use of several namespaces to map each ontological aspect onto the architecture of subjects, predicates and 
        objetcs is key to deliver a well structured RDF Model. 


        concept of namespaces used mainly
        ex:
        tc:
        od: - as 
        skos:
        rdfs:
        \cite{HGGS}

        To rely on proper methods of the design of software components a few small changes to the taxonomy of Eckardt's Ontology needed to be induced with
        several layers of abstraction(which are existing prototypically but are not described explicitely) and specification of the used predicates. 
        The description of the modelling will mainly focus on these parts, while explaining the structure of the ontology itself remains exemplarily, 
        as it has always been specified in the quoted material.

        four levels of hierarchy to distinguish descriptive modelling 
        0
        1
        2
        3

        the methodological practice described in this work is mainly based at level 2, meaning the modelled objects and subjects in terms of RDF refer to 
        the concept of classes used in object-oriented programming[SOURCE]. Therefore all properties of RDF objects described here are generic class
        properties, which have to be instanciated separately as a RDF triplet of rdfs:type|s referring a certain object of class properties

    \section{Critical review and further development}
        \subsection{Outside view - embedding the Flow Analysis Ontocard}
        For now this TRIZ Ontocard remains isolated from its embedded environment within the ontological hierarchy of the TOP and rules how and when to 
        apply a flow analysis method within the main process of inventive problem solving as it is proposed by the TRIZ model. A long term goal may be,
        that from an autonomous engineers perspective it should be possible to gain a programmatic manual how to solve a specific inventive or systemic
        problem only with the given RDF of the TRIZ Ontology, for which it has to be serializable.

        To embed the Flow Analysis Ontocard either a top down or a bottom up approach is applicable. For top down it needs to be clarified how
        Flow Analysis as one of the Top Level Ontologies fits in the structure with the remaining parts, especially LETS, the TRIZ application areas and
        the TRIZ Model. As it seems clear Eckardt already considered the connection to LETS and the TRIZ Model, for which these areas should be prioritized
        in the further development.
        
        Further, not only in terms of ontologization, it remains unclear where exactly the methodological framework of flow
        analysis is settled, how it can be derived or transformed from other system analysis methods, which methods from different approaches it includes
        or where other techniques may benefit from including flow analysis methods in terms of multiperspective modelling. There are severel concepts, 
        which use similar semantics or patterns to describe a problem, only on different levels of abstraction, especially those, which work on graph
        like structures. First mentioned here should be the process analysis framework and additionally function analysis as they intersect on a general
        conceptual level.

        Looking at processes, functions and flows in TRIZ terminology [ADD GLOSSARY SOURCES]\cite{WebinarNotes} a flow model is a special process model, where the process is a
        function in time between each of the components of the process. \cite{SysInno2017} In the flow analysis model a flow is also a function, though it derives not
        as a function between components, but as an emergent property of its components properties, which do not have functional properties only, but relational
        properties too, especially the control unit and the channel, which can not be grouped by source or receiver components bijectively in time. 
        So it's neither a classical process model nor a function model in its strict sense, thus combines aspects of both as flow is a function in time between nodes, 
        which combine multiple properties of different components, but with interdependet properties like ratio of flow rate and capacity. In the status
        quo these aspects are not covered explicitely by the flow analysis model.

        Further, the concept of substance field models(SFM) is closely related to the FAM. 'Analog to the function model the components are also connected
        via a function, but in the substance field model the energy or a specific form of energy is added.' \cite{SysInno2017} Thus, the substance field model
        matches the systemic structure of flow composition, leading to its definition as a physical quantity as a product of a field and a face. \cite{Fluss(Physik)}
        Even more, SFM uses the terminology of useful and harmful effects, too. \cite{SysInno2017} Therefore the linkage between those methods should be generalized in the
        future.

        Next mentioned should be its connection to the root conflict analysis. As already scribed in the introduction, cause and effect analysis and the
        identification of cause-effect-chains is a well described and established concept in TRIZ. As many rules of flow analysis and its techniques to
        change flows obviously imply a root conflict analysis, there is no ontological relation between these concepts and should be made explicit. 
        
        Yet, there are several other concepts in TRIZ that can be exploited using the flow analysis. Generally speaking, all models which describe 
        progress in time and map the ability and change of motion of some potential can be analyzed using the FAM. So it maybe should considered to
        review the concept of evolution of technical systems in terms of flow analysis, at least ontologically.
        
        While having focused mainly on the MATRIZ school, there exists a flow model in OTSM-TRIZ as well. Khomenko proposed a 'Problem Flow Approach',
        which uses a more abstract concept of flow. 

        

        \subsection{Inside view - methodological critics}
        Eckardts ontology of flow analysis as it is matches the basic methodological approach of TRIZ on how to change a problematic system in terms 
        of requirement engineering. It has a descriptive flow model and categorial connections what rules are needed to construct and evaluate a 
        flow model as it is and which have to be used to transform it into a flow model as it should be, while including some techniques how to change
        its static components to aim for the prefered requirements. Beside that basic descriptive perspective it does not meet the need on how
        to achieve demanded modifications of flow systems in specific cases, as it has been already noticed by Eckardt(algorithms and a matrix
        of methods of transformation of the model as is to the model as it should be as a possible next step \cite{Eckardt2020}').
        The proposed <<Techniques of Modification>> used by Eckardt for this transformation are based on the work of Lyubomirsky. While Eckardt established
        his categories of techniques how to increase useful flows and reduce of harmful flows by changing different static components, a more detailed analytic 
        point of view needs to adress which problematic effects can be solved using certain techniques. Further more, we need a map which decodes what
        properties of components can cause components to occur harmful properties, like grey zones, stagnation zones and so on. 
        But to establish these performative aspects the descriptive flow model needs to be improved as well. 
        Beside having properties for static components, which has already been regarded by Lyubomirsky and improved by Lebedev (like capacity or conductivity),
        \texttt{dynamic properties of flow}, for example resonance or flow rate, have to be
        defined to model how specific flow properties emerge out of the constellation of certain configuration of its static components and how they can be affected
        changing them.

        which change of components change which property of the flow
        how does the change of a flow property affect certain components
        
        This concludes, that an additionally level of abstraction is needed to account for the interconnection of flow and its components. The question
        is, how it can be modelled that a stagnation zone is only bad for useful flows but can be used to reduce harmful flows?
        At this point, only singular flows are issued by the FAM, meaning that it is not clear, if a global flow system is issued or a specific local flow.
        But it has to be considered, that synergistic effects on the one hand can cause contrary reactions on the other hand. A flow analysis therefore must 
        take the complexity of flow networks into account. Beside extending the descriptive flow model to spotlight on the systemic causation of these problems, 
        this is also a methodological issue. At the moment FAM focuses on methods, that emerge out of experienced based best practices in an engineering context.
        While establishing methodological concepts, that aim for generalization of categorial problem classes,
        they are mainly build for qualitive substance and energy flows only. Not to forget, that there are some blue prints adressing information flows, too, like
        the problem of conversion of flows and the concept of carrier and media flows, but these remain cursory.
        This rises the question: Which domains can be adressed by the actual model and which not? And further more, are the foundations of the TRIZ model sufficient to address complex problems in flow analysis, that cannot clearly distinct between
        useful and harmful flows. If we look at these techniques, they try to fulfill requirements orienting on one parameter at the time.
        But in practice, especially in a network of flows, you need to take multiple parameters into account, respectively distinguish between global and local
        parameterization. Therefore a quantization or numerical framework is needed, like it is applicated by graph theoretical concepts and optimization theory. 
        
         



         

        How can the vocabulary be used to apply it to certain domains, especially those which doesn't seem to be intuitively compatible to the generic techniques
        of flow modification.
