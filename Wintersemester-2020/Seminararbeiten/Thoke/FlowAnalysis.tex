\section{Aim of the work}

The aim of this paper is to elaborate a proposal for an ontological modelling
of the areas of \emph{TRIZ Flows} and \emph{TRIZ Flow Analysis} based on the
materials of the TRIZ Ontology Project (TOP) of the TRIZ Developer Summit
\cite{TOP} and further own investigations. The work fits into the activities
of the \emph{WUMM Project} \cite{WUMM} to accompany the TOP project and to
transfer it into the language of modern semantic concepts \cite{WUMMTOP}.  The
work therefore consists of two parts -- a \emph{turtle file}, in which the
semantic modelling is performed based on the SKOS framework \cite{SKOS}, and
\emph{this elaboration}, in which the backgrounds and motivations of the
concrete modelling decisions are detailed.

\section{Starting point} 

Flows and flow analysis play a rather peripheral role in TRIZ.  In the
standard reference \cite{Petrov2007} on a \emph{TRIZ Body of Knowledge} it is
listed as item 2.5.8, but in the 7 references to the literature listed there
are no systematic explanations about the role of flows in TRIZ theory, but
only individual examples in which concrete flows (such as magnetic flow)
played a role in concrete modelling.

The most comprehensive source on issues of TRIZ modelling of flows and
methodological issues of flow analysis is the thesis \cite{Lebedyev2015} by
Yuri Lebedyev, which he submitted in 2015 under the supervision of S.A. 
Logvinov for graduation as TRIZ Master.

Such a limitation is justified, since the aim of this seminar paper is not to
completely cover the TRIZ theory of flow analysis, but only to identify its
essential concepts and describe their connection with modern semantic RDF
means based on the SKOS ontology. The basis for this is above all the
presentation of Olga Eckardt in the webinar of the TOP project in October 2020
\cite{Eckardt2020}, in which basic approaches of Lebedyev's work have
obviously been incorporated.

We start from the definition of both concepts in the TOP Glossary
\cite{TOP-Glossary}: 
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Flow} is the directional movement in space of particles of mass of
matter, as well as the directional movement of energy or information. Flow
has dual properties: the properties of a substance of which the flow
consists, and the properties of a field, which is formed as a result of the
directional movement of particles of matter. Flows can be useful, harmful
and parasitic. The flow model contains static components: source, channel,
receiver, control system. Flow is a special case of a process in which
directional movement occurs in physical space.

\textbf{Flow analysis} is a method of systems analysis to establish
relationships in a system to flow, find resources, and determine compliance
with existing system requirements. The result of a flow analysis is a model
of the flow as is and a model of the flow to be. Flow modification
techniques are used to develop systems with flows and to solve inventive
problems in them.
\end{quote}

The use of these concepts is further included there in a single place in the
context of cause-effect analysis (ibid.):
\begin{quote}
Cause-effect analysis is performed: 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item When the causes of an undesirable effect are not clear (when we cannot
  go from an administrative contradiction to a technical one $AC\to TC$.
\item When it is necessary to clarify the causes of an undesirable effect (to
  deepen the understanding of the causes of an undesirable effect, e.g.  after
  a functional or a flow analysis).
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
Other sources are much more sparing in their statements on these two
individual terms, but list other flow-related concepts, for example in
\cite{Souchkov2018}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Delay Zone -- A location in a flow in which the integral flow speed is
  significantly lower than local flow speed. A Delay Zone is a typical
  disadvantage identified by Flow Analysis.
\item Flow -- A sequence of events that have the same common feature.
\item Flow Analysis -- An analytical method and a tool which identifies
  disadvantages in flows of energy, substances, and information in a technical
  system.
\item Flow Disadvantage -- A disadvantage of a technical system being analysed
  identified during Flow Analysis. Examples: Bottlenecks, «Gray Zones»,
  «Stagnation Zones», etc.
\item Flow Distribution Analysis -- A part of Flow Analysis that identifies
  distribution of flows and their disadvantages.
\item Stagnation Zone -- A part of a flow in which the flow stops temporarily
  or permanently. A Stagnation Zone is a typical disadvantage identified by
  Flow Analysis.
\item Transmission -- One of the key components (subsystems) of a Complete
  Technical System which according to the Law of System Completeness of a
  technical system transmits a flow of energy required to operate a working
  unit from an engine to the working unit.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Conceptualisations}
Being more than just a static methodology, there have been several approaches
to standardise the syntaxes and semantics of the conceptual and methodological
knowledge of TRIZ. Launching the TRIZ Ontology Project (TOP) several main
contributors of the MATRIZ school are pushing forward this longterm goal from
a very core institution of the TRIZ history.  In awareness of the importance
to establish uniform language models within human-machine-interface
environments the WUMM \cite{WUMM} TOP Companion Project \cite{WUMMTOP} is
pushing even further "to transform that information [...]", which has been
provided by the TOP, "[...] into RDF as the machine readable standard of the
Web 3.0 (also called 'Semantic Web')." \cite{WUMMTOP}.

"RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. [...] [It] extends
the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship between
things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a
'triple'). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured
data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications."
\cite{RDF}.

Given that framework, we can map the concepts of TRIZ onto a structure which
can be read and processed by computers using HTTP and link them to substantial
resources creating an environment to collaborate in innovative projects across
the world using semantic technologies.

To collect and manage this development of the RDF source code, a git
repository \cite{RDFData} is used and has been forked for developing the TRIZ
Analysis Ontocard feature as the main goal of this work. The README manual of
the repository provides necessary preliminaries for using and continue
developing the project.

The main part of the modelling workflow is the appropriate design how to
translate the ontological structure of the given topic into the RDF scope of
three-word-sentences.  Therefore the use of several namespaces to map each
ontological aspect onto the architecture of subjects, predicates and objetcs
is the key to deliver a well structured RDF Model.

The conceptualisations to be developed follow the basic assumptions and
settings, that are elaborated in more detail in \cite{Graebe2021}. In
particular, the following namespace prefixes are used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{ex:} -- the namespace of a special system to be modelled. 
\item \texttt{tc:} -- the namespace of the TRIZ concepts (RDF subjects).
\item \texttt{od:} -- the namespace of WUMM's own concepts (RDF predicates,
  general concepts).
\end{itemize}
Furthermore several standard ontologies are used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{skos:} -- the Simple Knowledge Organization System Namespace
  (mainly for labelling).
\item \texttt{foaf} -- the namespace of Friend of a Friend to describe real
  world objects.
\item \texttt{rdfs:} -- the namespace of RDF Schema (RDF properties and their
  domains).
\item \texttt{cc:} -- the namespace of the Creative Commons License (to
  address copy left approach).
\item \texttt{owl:} -- the namespace of the Web Ontology Language (to address
  web ontology conventions).
\end{itemize}

As in Souchkov's Glossary we use URIs as 
\begin{center}\tt
  tc:HarmfulAction, tc:HarmfulFunction,\\ tc:HarmfulInteraction,
  tc:HarmfulMachine
\end{center}
that combine the property and the subject of the property except for
\texttt{tc:FlowSubstance}.

As you can see, the WUMM project introduced the \texttt{od:} namespace to
extend the given ontological base of the TOP by its own concepts and provide
explicit definitions of certain abstract models, which are yet unclarified.

To see which predicates are used in the \texttt{od:} namespace, you can
query the WUMM SPARQL Endpoint \cite{SPARQL} 
\begin{code}
\> SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE {?s ?p ?o FILTER regex(?p, 'od')}.
\end{code}

\section{Modelling the Flow Analysis Ontocard}

Flow Analysis, as a rather niche method in TRIZ is grounded by two major
contributions: While Lyubomirsky \cite{Lyubomirsky2006} started with the
introduction of a broad set of methods to fix certain problems assigned to
flow as a functional magnitude, Lebedyev \cite{Lebedyev2011} \cite{Lebedyev2015}
catched up on it and developed a systematic approach of analysis of flows
based on the well known principles of TRIZ. Finally Eckardt \cite{Eckardt2020}
started to adopt this work integrating it as a part in the TOP.

As mentioned before and to rely on proper methods of the design of software
components a few small changes to the taxonomy of Eckardt's ontology needed to
be induced with several layers of abstraction (which are existing
prototypically but are not described explicitely) and specification of the
used predicates. The description of the modelling will mainly focus on these
parts, while explaining the structure of the ontology itself remains
exemplarily, as it has always been specified in the quoted material.

"An ontology is about 'modelling of models', because the clarification of
terms and concepts aimed at with an ontology is intended to be practically
used in real-world modelling contexts. This 'modelling of models' references a
typical engineering context, in which the \emph{modelling} of systems plays a
central role and serves as basis of further planned action (including project
planning, implementation, operation maintenance, further development of the
system).  In this process, \emph{several levels of abstraction} are to be
distinguished." \cite{Graebe2021}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item[0.] The level of the \emph{real-world system}. 
\item[1.] The level of \emph{modelling the real world system}. 
\item[2.] The \emph{level of the meta-model} as the actual (TRIZ) ontology on
  which the systemic concepts are \emph{defined}.
\item[3.] The \emph{modelling meta-level 2} at which the methodological
concepts are defined.\footnote{See \cite{Graebe2021} for more details.} 
\end{itemize}

The methodological practice described in this work is mainly based at level 2,
meaning the modelled objects and subjects in terms of RDF refer to the concept
of classes used in object-oriented programming.  Therefore all properties of
RDF objects described here are generic class properties, which have to be
instantiated separately as a RDF triples of \texttt{rdfs:type}s referring a
certain object of class properties.

The Flow Analysis Model can be separated in two parts. The \emph{Flow Model}
refers to the descriptive and functional properties of a flow, its (static)
components as abstract or concrete real world objects, that define its
properties and description methods, like textual or graphical representations.
The \emph{Flow Analysis (Model)} describes the given context of a flow
analysis, e.g. its requirements, rules that derive from general TRIZ
principles or the LETS, which form an overall solution process containing
methods how to solve problems using specific flow innovation methods.

\subsection{\texttt{tc:Flow}}

A flow is, on the one hand, a component within a system but on the other hand
can describe a system as a dynamic entity in the flow of time. The descriptive
and functional properties are modeled along the rules for a morphological
table, i.e. defining a PropertyDomain and a list of allowed values, modelled
with \texttt{od:allowedValues}, respective \texttt{valueOf} as listed below.
The model of Eckardt is slightly extended to cover the full model used by
Lebedyev. That is \texttt{tc:FlowDelegation} and the \emph{Carrier Flow Model},
which is basically obligatory to model the flow of flows and modeled here as a
special type of \texttt{tc:FlowFunctionality}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Property & PropertyDomain \\\hline
od:belongsTo & tc:StageValue \\
od:hasFlowType & tc:FlowType  \\
od:hasFlowSubstance & tc:FlowSubstance  \\
od:hasFlowFunctionality & tc:FlowFunctionality  \\
od:hasFlowDefect & tc:FlowDefect  \\
od:hasFlowSource & tc:FlowSource  \\
od:hasMethodOfDescription & tc:MethodOfDescription \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}\hline
PropertyDomain & PropertyValues \\\hline
tc:FlowType & tc:ComplexFlow, tc:DiscreteFlow, tc:ContinuousFlow \\
tc:FlowDelegation & tc:OpenFlow, tc:ClosedFlow \\
tc:FlowSubstance & tc:Information, tc:Energy, tc:Substance \\
tc:FlowFunctionality & tc:UsefulFlow, tc:HarmfulFlow, tc:ParasiticFlow, \\
& tc:CarrierFlow \\
tc:FlowDefect & tc:InsufficientFlow, tc:ExcessiveFlow, \\
& tc:BadControllableFlow, tc:AbsentFlow \\ 
tc:FlowSource & tc:ExternalSource, tc:InternalSource  \\
tc:MethodOfDescription & tc:TextDescription, tc:ParametricDescription, \\
& tc:GraphicDescription \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here you can see the triples associated with the flow subject:
\begin{code}
tc:Flow \\
\> a skos:Concept, od:SouchkovGlossaryEntry ; \\
\> od:WOPCategory od:Component; \\
\> od:SouchkovCategory tc:FlowAnalysis ; \\
\> od:SouchkovDefinition """A sequence of events that have the same common \\
\>\> feature."""@en ; \\
\> od:LebedyevDefinition """Motion of material, energetic or informational \\
\>\> objects within a system"""@en ; \\
\> skos:prefLabel "Flow"@en, "Fluss"@de, "\ru{Поток}"@ru ; \\
\> skos:altLabel "Stream"@en, "Strom"@de . 
\end{code}

\texttt{tc:StageValue} refers to the general concept of \texttt{tc:ModeValue}s
we'll see in action in the example, which is introduced later on. It defines
different models of flows, which are used along the flow analysis
transformation process. \texttt{od:Component} with its predicate
\texttt{od:WOPCategory} defines whether a component of the analysed system is
covered or with \texttt{od:PropertyDomain} properties of the flow as a
systematic approach is described. Each subject, that refers to a TRIZ concept
is a \texttt{skos:Concept}, as well as a \texttt{od:AdditionalConcept}. To
indicate that a \texttt{skos:definition} is due to a certain author, we use
subpredicates like \texttt{od:Lebedyev\-Defini\-tion} or
\texttt{od:SouchkovDefinition}. The \texttt{od:SouchkovCategory} refers to a
specific categorial object in Souchkov's glossary \cite{Souchkov2018}.

\subsection{Subconcepts of \texttt{tc:Flow}}

A flow consists of several physical parts (source, channel, receiver, control
unit) that are components by their own and hence modeled with the predicate
\texttt{od:subConceptOf}. For the moment they are attached to the flow with a
single predicate \texttt{od:hasStaticFlowComponent}. Yet, they have several
subcomponents, which are listed below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Property & PropertyDomain \\\hline
od:hasStaticFlowComponent & tc:StaticFlowComponent \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}\hline
Components & SubComponents \\\hline
tc:ControlUnit & tc:Pump, tc:Valve \\
tc:Receiver & (has no subcomponents yet) \\
tc:Source & tc:Current, tc:Potential \\
tc:Channel & (has no subcomponents yet)\\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{\texttt{tc:FlowAnalysis}}
Eckardt's model of flow analysis is separated into two levels of abstraction.
The \emph{Top Level View} contains a self descriptive methodological approach,
which parts of the flow analysis are relevant to carry out a flow
transformation process. The \emph{Technical View} describes how a
transformation is prescribed by its compliance rules and its LETS and how
requirements are met by solving the contradictions with several
\texttt{tc:TechniqesOfModification}.

The ontological representation of such a process is extremely difficult and is
not considered here. The ontology of the flow analysis is restricted to the
description of the \emph{formative elements of the analysis} and the creation
of a manually generated \emph{FlowTransformation} document.

\subsubsection{Top Level View}
A Flow Analysis is an methodological process. Its \emph{Top Level View}
conncects the given context and a set of rules, that define procedural
policies to create a project plan, the \texttt{tc:FlowTransformation} (a
\texttt{foaf:Document}, in a yet hypothetic \emph{Flow Transformation
  Description Language}) with the defined \texttt{tc:Flow} model in several
stages to define steps of evolution of the technical system and how to process
them to accomplish the desired transformative action\footnote{Addendum graebe:
  The abstraction levels (p. 6) are important here. The description of the
  methodology takes place at level 3, the application of the methodology uses
  language elements of level 2, the transformation of a concrete flow is
  described at level 1. Only at level 1 different instances of the flow exist
  next to each other as result of subsequent transformations.  And these
  instances have much in common and do vary only a little. Our ontologisation
  assumes that different instances in the namespace \texttt{ex:} are described
  by different RDF graphs if necessary, the transformation itself is described
  in an instance of \texttt{tc:FlowTransformation} as \texttt{foaf:Document}.
  This is a version of the problem of whether one can step into the same river
  twice. From an ontological point of view, the answer to this question is
  clearly "yes".}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Property & PropertyRange \\\hline
od:describesFlow & tc:Flow \\
od:analysesFlow & tc:Flow \\
od:inContext & tc:Context \\
od:followsRules & tc:RulesOfFlowTransformation \\
od:usesDescriptionMethods & tc:Flow, ex:FlowModelAsIs, \\
& ex:FlowModelAsRequired, tc:FlowTransformation \\
od:generatesFlowTransformation & tc:FlowTransformation \\
od:applyChanges & tc:Flow \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

While these properties usually operate from the Domain of
\texttt{tc:FlowAnalysis}, \texttt{od:apply\-Changes} gathers all approaches of
the Flow Analysis finally in the \texttt{tc:FlowTransformation} and thus can
be applied to the real system (level 0).

\texttt{tc:Context} encapsulates all information about the exact conditions
of the analysis and thus are modelled as \texttt{od:subConceptOf}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Concept & hasSubConcept \\\hline
tc:Context & tc:Goal, tc:Requirement \\
tc:Requirement & tc:IncreaseUsefulFlow, tc:ReduceHarmfulFlow, \\
& tc:ReduceParasiticFlow \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Technical View}
The Technical View combines two central concepts how and why methods are
applied in TRIZ. It connects the \texttt{tc:RulesOfFlowTransformation} with
the \emph{ModelAsIs} and the \emph{ModelAsRequired}. It contains their rules
of construction, integration of evaluation, their requirements and rules when
to use which \texttt{tc:TechniquesOfModification} to establish a target
transformation.

With \texttt{od:buildModelAsIs} and \texttt{od:buildModelAsRequired} we define
the predicates to describe the process how specific instances of a \emph{Flow
  Model} are built to define starting and desired target point of the flow
transformation.  Here, the \texttt{tc:RulesOfFlowTransformation} are attached,
that build a framework of design directives, not only how the models are
developed but also how these models are connected to establish a valid
solution out of the issued circumstances of flow analysis. While
\texttt{tc:RulesOfConstruction} and \texttt{tc:RulesofEvalution} refer to a
certain \texttt{ex:FlowModelAsIs}, the
\texttt{tc:RulesOfConstructionOfInconformRequirements} and the
\texttt{tc:RulesOfApplyingLawsOfDevelopmentOfTechnicalSystems} describe how
the evaluated contradictions in the \texttt{ex:FlowModelAsIs} can be resolved
via the knwon LETS to develop a \texttt{ex:FlowModelAsRequired}.

The \texttt{tc:TechniquesOfModification} is the last core piece of this
ontologisation of Flow Analysis. It is a set of methods that are derived from
certain LETS or so called trends occuring in technical systems that prescribe
certain processings \cite{KoltzeSouchkov2017}. \emph{They} are
\texttt{od:issuedAt} the \texttt{tc:ModelAsIs} to solve a certain
\texttt{tc:FlowDefect}.  Each of these methods are modeled as
\texttt{od:subConceptOf tc:TechniquesOfModification} and are categorised by
the static components they are intended to change. Additionally, they are
categorised by the overall requirement set in context.

For example:
\begin{code}
tc:TechniquesOfModification \\
\> od:issuedAt tc:ModelAsIs ; \\
\> od:forms tc:ModelAsRequired ; \\
\> od:hasSubConcept tc:ModificationOfReceiver, tc:ModificationOfSource, \\

\section{Example for Flow Analysis}
\subsection{Model of an Internal Combustion Engine}

To illustrate how this machine readable ontology can be used to model real
world problems, we introduce an example on how to improve the exhaust flow of
an internal combustion engine (ICE), which have been proposed by Lebedyev
\cite{Lebedyev2015}. We show how the flow model is implemented, address some
weaknesses that occured using the given Ontocard and translating it into RDF
and show how the Flow Analysis is applicated.

We used
\emph{Wikipedia}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine}}
to adjust the given example and meet the typical terminology. The granularity
stays on the level of the generality of the used terms.  This is an important
property of ontological modelling. You can go up and down that ladder as the
used analytical methods and vocabulary allow you to do. In the example this
can be seen in the specific categorisations and assignments to each level of
abstraction (see 6.), which change when you enter the terminology of an ICE or
are abstracted, when only the general categories of the flow analysis concepts
are met. This depends a lot on the given context, which is why there is yet no
general solution when to use which level of abstraction is sufficient.
Intuitively, the more the problem is located in specific components, that
refer to a special context in that domain, the more concrete the terminology
needs to be.

First we present the basic model of an ICE:
\begin{code}
ex:BasicInternalCombustionEngine \\
\> a tc:Flow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowType tc:ComplexFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowSubstance ex:Fuel, ex:Transmission, ex:Heat, ex:Work, \\
\>\> ex:Cooling, ex:Exhaust ; \\
\> od:hasFlowFunctionality tc:CarrierFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowDelegation tc:OpenFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowSource tc:InternalSource ; \\
\> od:hasStaticFlowComponent ex:FuelTank, ex:FuelPump, \+\\
\> ex:FuelSupplyPipe, ex:Atmosphere, ex:Compressor, ex:AirSupplyPipe,\\
\> ex:CoolingTank, ex:CoolingPump, ex:CoolingWaterJacket, \\
\> ex:IntakeValve, ex:InletCamshaft, ex:CombustionChamber, \\
\> ex:SparkPlug, ex:Cylinder, ex:Piston, ex:ConnectionRod, \\
\> ex:Crankshaft, ex:ExhaustCamshaft, ex:ExhaustValve, \\
\> ex:ExhaustPipe ; \-\\
\> od:hasMethodOfDescription tc:ParametricDescription, \\
\>\> ex:ICE3DModel ; \\
\> skos:prefLabel "Basic internal combustion engine"@en, \\
\>\> "Grundlegendes Modell eines Verbrennungsmotors"@de  ; \\
\> skos:note """Basic construction model from wikipedia \\
\>\> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal\_combustion\_engine>""" . 
\end{code}

Here you can see some decisions on abstraction and findings. We focused on
concrete descriptions of \texttt{tc:FlowSubstance} and
\texttt{tc:StaticFlowComponent}s as they are sufficient to show the problems
of an exhaust flow and how to model an easy improvement.

Thus, the ICE is already a complex machine, where you have at least two
interdependent system levels, i.e. a flow of flows. But the given Ontocard
doesn't define rules how systems of systems, respectively flows of flows, are
modelled, because the Flow Model lacks a model of self description. Thats why
this modelling is still experimental. Therefore we made some assumptions: 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A \texttt{tc:FlowSubstance} on the second level is a \texttt{tc:Flow} on
  the first level.
\item The \texttt{tc:FlowFunctionality} of a second order flow is always a
  \texttt{tc:CarrierFlow}\footnote{See chapter 7 in \cite{Lebedyev2015}. }.
\end{itemize}

So let us have a look at the \texttt{ex:Exhaust} flow:
\begin{code}
ex:Exhaust \\
\> a tc:Flow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowType tc:DiscreteFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowSubstance tc:Substance ; \\
\> od:hasFlowFunctionality tc:HarmfulFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowDelegation tc:OpenFlow ; \\
\> od:hasFlowSource tc:InternalSource ; \\
\> od:hasStaticFlowComponent ex:CombustionChamber, ex:ExhaustPipe, \\
\>\> ex:Atmosphere, ex:ExhaustValve, ex:ExhaustCamshaft ; \\
\> skos:prefLabel "The exhaust flow"@en, "Abgasstrom"@de . \\
\end{code}

\texttt{ex:Exhaust} is a \texttt{tc:HarmfulFlow} with several static
components. These components are not exclusive for the exhaust flow.  They are
used in other flow systems as different flow components. For example the
\texttt{ex:CombustionChamber}, here modelled as \texttt{a tc:Potential}, is
\texttt{a tc:Channel} in the system of the \texttt{tc:Heat} flow. To inherit
context sensitivity to these subjects, we use \texttt{od:specialCase}:
\cite{RDFC}

\begin{code}
ex:CombustionChamber \\
\> od:specialCase ex:Heat, ex:InternalCombustionEngine ; \\
\> a tc:Channel ; \\
\> skos:prefLabel "Combustion chamber"@en, "Verbrennungskammer"@de .
\end{code}

\subsection{Improvement of the \texttt{tc:Exhaust} Flow}

We now have a model of a \emph{system as is}, which can be used for
improvement.  As already mentioned, we want to describe the process of exhaust
flow innovation. Given the context of \texttt{ex:PollutionRestrictions}, we
define the goal \texttt{ex:SatisfactionOfPollutionRestric\-tions} with the
requirements to reduce the exhaust flow while the work flow needs to be
preserved as good as possible 
\begin{code}
\> \texttt{ex:InnovationOfExhaustFlow} \texttt{od:hasRequirement}
  \texttt{ex:ReduceExhaustFlow},\\\>\> \texttt{ex:PreserveWorkFlow} .
\end{code}
We define a specific \texttt{foaf:Document} to hold all information about the
innovation project, that describes which flows need to be described and
analysed, following a \emph{ModelAsIs}, as well as a \emph{ModelAsRequired},
(called \texttt{ex:ICEExhaustionModel} and

\section{Conclusion, critical review and further development}

\subsection{Outside view -- embedding the Flow Analysis Ontocard}

For now this TRIZ Ontocard remains mostly isolated from its embedded
environment within the ontological hierarchy of the TOP and rules how and when
to apply a flow analysis method within the main process of inventive problem
solving as it is proposed by the TRIZ model. A long term goal may be, that
from an autonomous engineers perspective it should be possible to gain a
programmatic manual how to solve a specific inventive or systemic problem only
with the given RDF of the TRIZ Ontology, for which it has to be serialisable.

To embed the Flow Analysis Ontocard either a top down or a bottom up approach
is applicable. For top down it needs to be clarified how Flow Analysis as one
of the Top Level Ontologies fits in the structure with the remaining parts,
especially LETS, the TRIZ application areas and the TRIZ Model. As it seems
Eckardt already considered the connection to LETS and the TRIZ Model, for
which these areas should be prioritised in the further development.

Further, not only in terms of ontologisation, it remains unclear where 
exactly the metho\-do\-logical framework of flow analysis is settled, how 
it can be derived or transformed from other system analysis methods, 
which methods from different approaches it includes or how other 
techniques may benefit from including flow analysis methods in terms of
multiperspective modelling. There are several concepts, which use 
similar semantics or patterns to describe a problem, only on different 
levels of abstraction, especially those, which work on graph like 
structures. First mentioned here should be the process analysis 
framework and additionally function analysis as they intersect on a 
general conceptual level.

Looking at processes, functions and flows in TRIZ terminology
\cite{Souchkov2018} \cite{Eckardt2020} a flow model is a \emph{special process
  model}, where the process is a function in time between each of the
components of the process \cite{KoltzeSouchkov2017}. In the flow analysis
model a flow is also a function, though it appears not as a function between
components, but as an emergent property of its components properties, which do
not have functional properties only, but relational properties too, especially
the control unit and the channel, which can not be grouped by source or
receiver components bijectively in time. So it is neither a classical process
model nor a function model in its strict sense, and combines aspects of both
as flow is a function in time between nodes, which combine multifold
properties of different components, but with interdependent properties like
ratio of flow rate and capacity. In the status quo these aspects are not
covered explicitely by the flow analysis model.

Further, the concept of \emph{substance field models} (SFM) is closely related
to the FAM. "Analog to the function model the components are also connected
via a function, but in the substance field model the energy or a specific form
of energy is added." \cite{KoltzeSouchkov2017}. Thus, the substance field
model matches the systemic structure of flow composition, leading to its
definition as a physical quantity as a product of a field and a (sur)face
\cite{Flussdefinition(Physik)}.  Even more, SFM uses the terminology of useful
and harmful effects, too \cite{KoltzeSouchkov2017}. Therefore the linkage
between those methods should be generalised in the future.

Next mentioned should be its connection to the \emph{root conflict analysis}.
As already mentioned in the introduction, cause and effect analysis and the
identification of cause-effect-chains is a well established concept in TRIZ.
As many rules of flow analysis and its techniques to change flows obviously
imply a root conflict analysis, there is not yet an ontological relation
between these concepts.  This should be made explicit.

Yet, there are several other concepts in TRIZ that can be exploited using Flow
Analysis. Generally speaking, all models which describe progress in time and
map the ability and change of motion of some potential can be analysed using
FAM. So it seems worth to review the concept of evolution of technical systems
in terms of flow analysis, at least ontologically.

While having focused mainly on the MATRIZ school, there exists a flow model in
OTSM-TRIZ as well. Khomenko proposed a \emph{Problem Flow Approach}, which
uses a more abstract concept of flow and combines aspects of network modelling
of problems and solutions and technology flow characteristics
\cite{Khomenko2007} \cite{KhomenkoFlow-1} \cite{KhomenkoFlow-2}.  This should
be analysed in detail to gain knowledge about how these concepts align with
the approach of the MATRIZ school or can uncover additional perspectives of
flow modelling.

\subsection{Inside view -- methodological critics}

Eckardt's ontology of flow analysis, as it is, matches the basic
methodological approach of TRIZ on how to change a problematic system in terms
of requirement engineering. It has a descriptive flow model and categorial
connections to certain rules, that are needed to construct and evaluate a
\emph{Flow Model As It Is} and how they are used to transform it into a
\emph{Flow Model As Required}, while including some techniques how to change
its static components to aim for the preferred requirements. Beside that basic
descriptive perspective it does not meet the need how the demanded
modifications of flow systems are being processed, as it has been already
noticed by Eckardt (algorithms and a matrix of methods of transformation of
the model as is to the model as it should be as a possible next step
\cite{Eckardt2020}). The proposed \emph{Techniques of Modification} used by
Eckardt for this transformation are based on the work of Lyubomirsky. While
Eckardt implemented his categories of techniques how to increase useful flows
and reduce of harmful flows by changing different static components, a more
detailed analytic point of view needs to address which problematic effects can
be solved using certain techniques. Furthermore, we need a map which decodes
what properties of components can cause components to occur harmful
properties, like grey zones, stagnation zones and so on.  But to establish
these performative aspects the descriptive flow model needs to be improved as
well. To allow the modelling of higher order flow systems, we've upgraded
Eckardt's proposal to the concepts introduced by Lebedyev \cite{Lebedyev2015}
and added experimental design guidelines to connect flows on different
systemic levels in RDF. These should be reviewed and adjusted to a profound
level of acceptance.

Beside having properties for static components, which has already been
regarded by Lyubo\-mirsky and improved by Lebedyev (like capacity or
conductivity), \emph{dynamic properties of flow}, for example resonance or
flow rate, have to be defined to model how specific flow properties emerge out
of the constellation of certain configurations of its static components and
how they can be affected changing them.  Reflecting this, a concept of how the
process of changing components change the properties of the emerging flow and
how specific flow properties can be achieved by changing certain static
components is needed.

This concludes, that an additional level of abstraction is needed to account
for the interconnection of flow and its components. The question is, how it
can be modelled that a stagnation zone is only bad for useful flows but can be
used to reduce harmful flows? At this point, only singular flows are issued by
the FAM precisely, meaning that it is not clear, if a global flow system is
issued or a specific local flow.  But it has to be considered, that synergetic
effects on the one hand can cause contrary reactions on the other hand. A flow
analysis therefore must take the complexity of flow networks into account.
Beside extending the descriptive flow model to spotlight on the systemic
causes of these problems, this is also a methodological issue. At the moment
FAM focuses on methods, that emerge out of experienced based best practices in
an engineering context. While establishing methodological concepts, that aim
for generalisation of categorial problem classes, they are mainly built for
qualitive substance and energy flows only. Not to forget, that there are some
blueprints addressing information flows, too, like the problem of conversion
of flows and the concept of carrier and mediating flows, but these remain
cursory. This rises the question: Which domains can be addressed by the actual
model and which not? And furthermore, are the foundations of the TRIZ model
sufficient to address complex problems in flow analysis, that cannot clearly
distinct between useful and harmful flows. If we look at these techniques,
they try to fulfill requirements orienting on one parameter at the time. But
in practice, especially in a network of flows, you need to take multiple
parameters into account, respectively to distinguish between global and local
parameterisation.  Therefore a quantisation or numerical framework is needed,
like it is applied by graph theoretical concepts and optimisation theory
\cite{FN}.  Mentioning the discussion of the \emph{TRIZ Ontology Webinar}
\cite{TOW}, the inclusion of STEM or MINT concepts is a huge black spot.
Neither general concepts like \emph{Material Flow Analysis} \cite{MFA} or
\emph{Fluid Dynamics} \cite{FD} are considered, nor well established ones on
information flow, like \emph{Supply Chain Management} or \emph{Traffic Flow
  Control} \cite{TF}. It is clear that the integration of each of these
concepts is a load of work but necessary to obtain a general model of flow
analysis in the future.
