## From the Chat

- How is the concept of organisation related to the previous ones? Formal
  organisation? Living organisation?

- How does the concept of leadership relate to the previous use of the term
  (which was mainly reduced to human resources management)?

- What distinguishes "human resources" from other resources?
  - See also my notes on resources to the last seminar.

- What exactly is meant by schematisation? What is behind the level concept?

- Functional coupling and processual coupling. Coupling as a phenomenon
  _between_ systems?

- How the concepts of _Generalised object_ and _filling_ relate to the problem
  of _resource use_ (in the system) versus _resource provision_ (from another
  system).
