# Seminar on 20 April 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  System Management, Organizations, Systems. Basic Notions
* __Presenter:__ Hans-Gert Gräbe

## Abstract

The handout focuses on first clarifying the basic terms "systematic
management", "organisation" and "system". I will dwell longer on the
conceptual developments in (Sommerville 2015, Ch. 13). 

Product quality essentially depends on the quality of internal processes and
thus ultimately on management quality (in a variation of a Latin saying: Only
a healthy company produces healthy products). This is a central conviction of
systematic management theories.

Being the starting point of "Systematic Management", ISO 9000 and the CMMI
maturity model emphasise the importance of systematically building and
expanding the structural and material basis of management decisions over the
outstanding mental and organisational skills of individual managers.

## From the Chat 

- Ralf Laue : Where does the ORG ontology come from? Is it a standard?  Where
  is it published?
  - <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/>
  - Quote from it:
    - This ontology is designed to enable publication of information on
      organizations and organizational structures including governmental
      organizations. It is intended to provide a generic, reusable core
      ontology that can be extended or specialised for use in particular
      situations.
    - The ontology gives terms to support the representation of:
      - organisational structure
        - notion of an organisation
        - decomposition into sub-organizations and units
        - purpose and classification of organizations
      - reporting structure
        - membership and reporting structure within an organisation
        - roles, posts, and the relationship between people and organisations
      - location information
        - sites or buildings, locations within sites
      - organisational history (merger, renaming)

- Kleemann : are there any serious reflections on the the problem of
  transferring system categories to descriptions of organisations?
  - This will be an essential topic of our seminar, after we succeeded to
    define both (the terms "system" and "organisation") more precisely.

- Veronika Heuten : In sociology, organisations are described as entities with
  membership conditions that reproduce themselves through their decisions.
  Can we now just check this off under "to do stuff"?
  - The perspective that "Agents do stuff" on the FOAF web site
    <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/> is on a very high level of abstraction (due
    to the goal of FOAF to express only very basic social relations).
    Reproduction of social structures includes that the contradiction between
    planned action ("doing stuff") and experienced results has to be
    processed, hence "reproduce themselves" refers to a very complicated
    process of development of a viable structure.

- Daniel Werner : On slide 16: point 3, yu wrote "only in large quantities".
  The Bugatti, for example, is produced in very small quantities, but
  nevertheless there is certainly a product design for it.  Should we add "big
  price per item" to this?  In other words, it must be worthwhile to create a
  product design.
  - In many cases it is _not_ worth to create a product design (or to create
    it on a different abstraction level). Large TS as, e.g., enterprises are
    unique specimen.  On the other hand to benefit from the economy of scales
    product design gets an independent meaning.  This difference is pointed
    out because it is missing in all system definitions within TRIZ that we
    are aware about.

- Kleemann : Flat hierarchies coordinate themselves through mostly agile
  methods, but they have the problem of (Scrum) mastering, thus a sprint
  organisation and consultation to the product owner, therefore to ask whether
  flat can really guarantee flat?
  - Scrum is already a well elaborated management methodology, so what does
    "agile" mean?  This very significant development can be traced back to the
    1990th, when IBM replaced the principle of command-and-control, i.e. the
    system of command and obedience, by indirect control. "There is now only
    one framework condition: do what you want, but be profitable!"
    (Glißmann/Peters 1997)
