## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  The Toyota Management System
* __Presenter:__ Toni Pfeiffer

## Abstract

The presentation refers to the book ”The Toyota Way - 14 Management Principles
of the World’s Most Successful Automotive Company” by Jeffrey K. Liker.
Jeffrey Liker analyzed Toyota’s success and discovered 14 methods that enabled
Toyota to become the most successful automotive company in the world.

In order to understand the success of Toyota, it is necessary to look at the
history of the company which will be explained in more detail.  The Toyota
Production System, another component of success, will be described only
briefly. Here we focus on the management methods that describe Toyota’s
holistic approach. The individual principles were divided by Liker into 4
categories, also called the 4 P’s Philosophy, Processes, People/Partners and
Problem Solving. These categories can be thought of as a pyramid with 4
levels.  Problem solving is the top of the pyramid. The most important is the
foundation, the philosophy of the company. This philosophy runs through all
management levels and eras and started with the founding Toyoda family 80
years ago.

## Notes

- Father Toyoda - what role does the generation of inventors and entrepreneurs
  around the turn of the century 1900 (as well as Werner Siemens) play in the
  formation of today's management structures?

- In contrast to previous approaches, the Toyota approach focuses on
  organisational development and not only on management of people. The complex
  system of rules is part of a "cooperate identity", which has a massive
  ideological effect in the sense of homogenising goals throughout the
  organisation.

- Toyota House - Unity of Parts. To what extent does this realise
  Shchedrovitsky's approach "The whole and its parts" (Shch.: A living
  organism cannot be broken down into parts, only a dead organism; breaking it
  down into parts and putting them together to form the whole provides a
  different whole)?  Toyota rule 12 on developmental approach is a specific
  approach to the second problem. Hegel? Learning organisation. Subject
  formation at the level of cooperative structure?

- Just in time - interplay of resource and resource management categories.

- Pyramid of the four levels - to what extent do systems theory approaches
  play a role here?

- Philosophy - socio-cultural approach, but is an external effect (export
  functions of the system), also Toyota rule 11 on networks. This is also
  about management of external relations over which one has no direct
  management influence.

- Elimination of waste - internally the process dimension stands above the
  structure dimension.  Shchedrovitsky criticises "classical" approaches for
  not having a clear concept of process.  TRIZ also has difficulties with the
  concept of flows.

- Pull system means a massive coupling of the parts of the whole system.  How
  does structuring work in such an approach?

- Quality immediately - corresponds to the rule known from QA in computer
  science that early detection and elimination of errors saves costs. (Errors
  propagate like avalanches if they are not recognised).

- How does Toyota deal with undetected errors? This is the main problem in
  classical systems.

- "Engineer on site who knows the process best". This refers to decisions on
  technological processes. What about larger administrative processes? How are
  those influenced in terms of design and who decides that?  Chief engineer,
  middle and strategic management? Relationship between acquisition,
  purchasing and production?  See also the Toyota principle on Leaders Scheme.

- Toyota principle 10 People: Shchedrovitsky also distinguishes between group
  and organisational unit.  Here an attempt is made to shape the
  organisational unit into a group. However, here there are reproducing
  contradictions between the goals of the individuals and the goals of the
  organisational unit.

- Decision-making: Justified expectations vs. experienced rsults. The
  principle of consensual decision-making is also known from open source:
  "Rough consensus and running code". To what extent does this play a role
  here?

- Troubleshooting: TRIZ knows RCA+ (root cause analysis) as a method of
  analysis.  The approach is methodological, how is it linked with
  domain-specific aspects, which is essential for solving concrete problems?

- CMMI level 5 knows troubleshooting _and_ change management.
