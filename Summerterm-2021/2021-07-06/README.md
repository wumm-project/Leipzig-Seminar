## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Russell Ackoff. Interactive Planning
* __Presenter:__ Daniel Werner

## Abstract

Interactive Planning is a methodology derived by Russel L. Ackoff, in his book
„Creating the Corporate Future: Plan or Be Planned for“ (Wiley, 1981). It is
build upon the basic concept that the future of a company depends on what
actions and events it realizes in the present, aiming towards an ideal future.
Interactive Planning (IP), and trough its execution their planner, wants to
design a desirable present which it then tries to approximate as good as
possible. The approach clearly sees the interdependence of problems and
incorporates this into its planning.  Ackoff based this idea on the ideal of
his so called „Interactivist“ , who wants to actively shape the future of the
organization. The „Interactivist“ accepts that the future cannot be predicted
and planned for in an all-encompassing way.

##  From the Chat


Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- We learned so far about an exciting diversity of approaches to management
  - Management by incentive, by objective which is primarily directes at
    management of people (management = leadership?)  
  -  Business Process Modelling is gaining more and more importance.
  - Here with Ackoff more precise process-analytical and
    process-organisational concepts, in which leadership is hardly in the
    (primary) focus, but the concept does not stop at the modelling level but
    is also about implementation of the model in reality.

- How are these changes of the focus of management theory to be evaluated and
  at what are their turning points in time?

- How does Ackoff understand approximation _as a process_?
  - Kleemann : I would be interested in the way or rather the way of dealing
    with iteration.

- "Ideal future" - how does this relate to the concept of the "ideal end
  result" in TRIZ?

- What do "bottom-up" and "top-down" mean from a systemic point of view?

- Problem of eliminating undesirable effects leads to further harmful effects.
  This is very well known from TRIZ, where this phenomenon is approached
  systematically.

- _Interactivist_ - connection to the feeedback circle "reasonable
  expectations -> experienced results" from the lecture. (Principle of
  Continuity)

- Principle of Participation: Building a Cooperative World View

- Holistic Principle: Which level concept does play a role there?

- Idealisation and Realisation - parallels to Design Thinking?

- _The Mess_ - phase of delimiting the system (in our understanding of system
  as "reduction to essentials", the Mess is _not_ "the system", but "reality",
  which, however, can only be grasped linguistically).

- Obstruction Analysis - is precisely analysis of contradictions. Are there
  several analytical levels of contradiction analysis here as in the phase
  model of TRIZ (or the path model of ProHEAL)?
  - ProHEAL: <https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-749491>

- How algorithmically detailed is the analysis phase (which corresponds to
  modelling).

- Reference scenario: In ProHEAL there are the terms "base variant" and
  "reference variant".

- Shocking reference scenario: Corresponds to the mental variation of the
  action parameters in TRIZ up to their limits and beyond.

- On what happened to Bell and AT&T in the 1950s.
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Communications_Inc.>
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System>

- "Three parts" - is exactly what TRIZ also calls for in the modelling phase:
  1) PNF as external "usefulness" of the system as a black box for other
     systems.
  2) Structural organisation of the system as a white box (The "machine" in
     the TRIZ trainer).
  3) "How the machine works" (which has subsequently to be implemented).

- Management: Is this only about the control component of the system,
  i.e. management as a _function_, or also about the qualities of the managers
  with whom the positions are to be filled? Problem of the principle of single
  management (often depends more on the person than on the authorisation of
  the role).  Consultants - this means stregthening management as a
  _function_.

- Personnel: This is about personnel development as a system _different_ from
  the system of operative production.  What are the coupling points between
  the two systems? In general: (description of) resource requirements (in one
  system) and (real) provision of the resource (by another system).  The
  latter requires (re)production of the resource itself.

- What are _gaps_ in this notion? Do contradictions always appear as gaps? Or
  are gaps the gaps in the model yet to be filled?

- "Disruptive approach" - the problem is that planning itself must be
  understood as a development process. SCRUM comes much closer to this. But
  this is also a problem of TRIZ (less so, as technical systems have a
  different development dynamic than social systems) and Business TRIZ, and
  perhaps also of ProHEAL (at least according to a comment by A. Solodkin).

Veronika Heuten : My question would be whether Ackoff developed the theory
via observation or did he put it all down on paper theoretically? I have the
impression that here again a lot is about feeling, intuition and experience.

- HGG: Although most of his concepts are strongly based on experience Ackoff
  developed his theoretical ideas in the 1970s under the influence of
  cybernetics and under the preception wide spread at that time that computers
  and information processing pave the way to a society of command and control.
- This had a great influence even on the development of professional profiles,
  in West and East, for example
  <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facharbeiter_f%C3%BCr_BMSR-Technik>
- Such dreams of a completely plannable production exist and there were even
  attempts to implement that in certain regions of the world.
