Ralf Laue : For those who are interested... I collected some time ago for a
lecture of my own:

- S: specific, simple, sensitive, significant
- M: measurable, meaningful, motivating
- A: achievable, agreed, attainable, action-oriented
- R: relevant, reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based
- T: time bound, time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely,
  time-sensitive

Summary - a certain arbitrariness is already recognisable.

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- What is the difference between goals (short term) and objectives (long
  term)?  Is it possible to make this conceptually clearer?
  - SHAMSA seems to see it the other way round. (Goal = strategic objective,
    Objectives = specific steps).
  - This was also the interpretation in the presentation. 

- Can we break down the 5 SMART terms again more precisely?
  - SMART objectives as efficient objectives. Are there SMART goals?
  
  - specific = specific area of improvement
    - Corresponds to TRIZ system and operational zone

  - measurable = What does measure mean?
    - In CMMI quantitative methods plays a role in at maturity level 4 only
      ("quantitatively managed"), when cross-company process templates have
      already been defined.  Only in such a cross-company setting there is a
      frame to learn from the collected data.

  - achievable = It is mainly about the (physical or mental) resources
    required for the activity.
    - How is the allocation of resources to be understood?
    - Who is responsible for the availability of resources?

  - relevant = Where does relevance come from?  
    - What is the relationship to other objectives?    
    - How is the link between goals and objectives established?
    - Does this have anything to do with BP modelling?

  - time-bound = inherent theme of every project (project has 3
    characteristics: goal, resources, time).
    - Do goals also have a time-bound or only objectives?

- What does "_management_ by objectives" mean? So far only the _definition_ of
  objectives has been discussed, i.e. the description dimension. What is the
  connection to management as execution dimension?
  - This was one of the main insights: Management is about operation of _real_
    processes (Shchedrovitsky: "Only a moving system can be managed").  The
    different description forms (BP modelling as also talking about SMART) are
    only a supporting tool for the _real_ management.

- Job fit - how is this to be understood? Role concept as description of
  requirements. But how is matching organised? "Job" as a typically American
  term? Employees as _objects_ of management? A completely different approach
  compared to MBI?

- How is "value" of an employee determined? Doesn't it depend centrally on the
  _objectives_, which means that the "value" changes fundamentally when the
  objectives change?

- Every employee is a manager - so also Doran (at least if you plan making a
  career; experts only never make career). We have had this question before.
  How is the "value question" applied to the managers themselves?

- Make objectives as abstract as necessary.  What does "abstract" mean here?
  "Abstract" as in "abstract class"? But, as we know, they can't be
  instantiated.
  
- How does this relate to BP Modelling and BPMN?

- Daniel Werner : It sounds like a complete rationalisation of the workplace.
  How long does an employee have to perform "poorly" for once to be demoted,
  replaced or even fired? This forces an absolute meritocracy, where not even
  acquired qualifications secure a job.

- Jannis de Riz : But if I always keep all employees, even if their skills are
  no longer needed, then at some point I risk the employment of ALL employees
  because I go bankrupt paying salaries to people that do not "support" /
  "generate" throughput.

- Daniel Werner : Without a feedback loop to the SMART Objectives (which are
  set by the manager himself) and since the manager can completely withdraw
  from this delegation process, the role of the "manager" appears here as an
  absolute, almost infallible entity.
