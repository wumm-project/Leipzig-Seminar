* __Theme:__  Business Process Definition Metamodel &ndash; BPDM
* __Presenter:__ B.D.

## Abstract

To be able to manage a processes within an organization it is necessary to be
able to describe the process in an unambiguous way. This enables the
comparison of different processes without actually implementing them. This in
turn is necessary to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
modifications to this process. Different metamodels are applicable like petri
networks, UML-activity diagrams or event-driven process chain charts. One of
the more common metamodels used for this application are BPMN models. To
enable automated translation from one metamodel into another and improve
cross-organizational communication about business processes the Business
Process Definition Metamodel (BPDM) was created. The idea behind BPDM is to
define a very extensive set of concepts so that other modeling tools can
easily be implemented in a compatible way by providing mappings from their own
modeling language to the concepts of BPDM.
