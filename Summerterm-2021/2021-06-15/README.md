## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Mintzberg on Management
* __Presenter:__ Felix Walter

## Abstract

Henry Mintzberg proposes new conceptual relationship to management,
organizations and the world constituted by organizations. The subject of
management, the manager, is detached from known attributes and receives a
theoretical role description in the form of interpersonal, information and
decision-oriented roles. Based on this, strategy development in management is
highlighted as a craft, which is postulated as a synthesis process of
analytical thinking and intuitive action, similar to the consideration of the
neurophysical findings of left and right brain hemispheres. In this context,
he criticizes the training of managers in MBA programs, which, according to
him, rely too much on analytical studies and neglect the "practical" parts.

Furthermore, he introduces new classifications of organizations as structural
forms and power processes, which can be subdivided into seven types of
configurations and described by basic characteristics. Here, organizations are
equated with configurations. The differentiation of configurations are
presented as
* entrepreneurial organization,
* machine organization,
* organization of professionals,
* diversified organization,
* innovative organizations,
* missionary organizations and
* political organizations.

Furthermore, he supplements the configuration with the concept of form, which
can be characterized as a force property in organizations and integrates it
into a life cycle model. Finally, he proposes control mechanisms for
organizations in society to prevent power concentration and presents a
critique towards the formation of society through the construction of
organizations and their characteristics.

## Notes

##  From the Chat

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- Are Mintzberg's arguments a plea for Ralf Laue's thesis that most management
  theories are just academic games without practical relevance anyway?
  Mintzberg's arguments are a huge edifice of empirically founded and
  inductively generalised theses, which are hardly supported by deductive
  arguments.

- What does it mean: Our world = "society of organisations" (living
  organisation in the sense of Shchedrovitsky)?
  - How close are the managerial concepts of Shchedrovitsky and Mintzberg?  

- Rituals, ceremonies, agreements - are this institutionalised procedures?

- Management is not a profession? But there is MBA training and even special
  management schools like HHL, with extremely expensive training?

- TRIZ approach of organisation as a system, with component "control".  How
  does the manager fit into this?

- Is it necessary to distinguish between the _role_ of manager and the
  _occupation_ of the role?

- Role of manager is defined by 10 aspects. Is the role image of manager
  independent of the state of the organisation?

- Manager as craftsman? as engineer? as artist? Example of the potter.

- Metaphor of the potter draws maximally on "experiences". Mintzberg's thesis:
  experiences are more important than systematic knowledge.  Means that the
  centre of management activity is _practice_, systematic reflective moments
  are only support and tools.

- But in organisations there are also structure-building processes, how are
  such _practical_ structure-building processes related to the design of
  structures? What about - besides structural - functional and processual
  elements of description?  What is the significance of BP Modelling?

- Picture of the brain: Actually, only pictorial (or associative) and
  linguistic (or analytical) thinking are contrasted.

- Thesis: Plan analytically, act associatively?

- Concept of organisation - 7 forms ("configurations") - what is distinguished
  here?

- Do organisations develop? Are there differences and transitional forms
  between the 7 "configurations"?

- Ideology = Cooperate Identity? Shchedrovitsky makes it clear that the
  "goals" of the organisation are different from those of the employees and
  that the employees have to be aligned with the goals of the organisation.
  How does this play out here?

- Basic types:

  1. New owner-managed company (start-up, bootstrap)

  2. Established owner-managed company (unclear whether it can also be AG)

  3. Diversified organisation (group structure - by merging formerly
     independent companies, state structures ??)

  4. Organisation of professionals (are professionals also managers?)

  5. Innovative organisation (What does this mean? Do they have a core
     business? What is the difference to 1.)

  6. Missionary organisation (strategic management? "Charisma of the leader is
     institutionalised")

  7. Political organisation (power play as a form of management?)

- Completely incomprehensible in all 7 types: By what "throughput" are they
  driven (see our concept of system)?

- To what extent is a manager always also a politician? What is a politician?
  Distinction between legislative and executive necessary?

- Force and counterforce - Plays an important role in the system context as
  homeostasis (and goes back to Newton: actio = reactio). Only the interaction
  of force and counterforce leads to structure formation.

- How is "machine" to be understood as an organisational context?  In the TRIZ
  trainer, a similar general concept of machine is used.

- Does Minzberg have the concept of autopoiesis as "self-development"?

- How should one understand "control of an organisation"? Is it internal
  control by the control component of the system or "external control"? In
  what framework does this "external control" take place if not as "internal
  control" in the upper system?

- Why "a machine does not have a will of its own" if it imposes it on people?
  See also my Marx quote in the first lecture.

- Jannis : accepting as a way of approaching the subject of management?

- V. Heuten : I will definitely continue to think about the intuition
  approach.  Since there are already some tough pleas for the abolition of
  these management courses.

- Daniel Werner : I also find it difficult to criticise here, because
  Mintzberg's approaches contrast so strongly with our previous considerations
  of systematic management.
