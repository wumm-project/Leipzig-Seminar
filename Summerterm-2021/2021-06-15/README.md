* __Theme:__  Mintzberg on Management
* __Presenter:__ Felix Walter

## Abstract

Henry Mintzberg proposes new conceptual relationship to management,
organizations and the world constituted by organizations. The subject of
management, the manager, is detached from known attributes and receives a
theoretical role description in the form of interpersonal, information and
decision-oriented roles. Based on this, strategy development in management is
highlighted as a craft, which is postulated as a synthesis process of
analytical thinking and intuitive action, similar to the consideration of the
neurophysical findings of left and right brain hemispheres. In this context,
he criticizes the training of managers in MBA programs, which, according to
him, rely too much on analytical studies and neglect the "practical" parts.

Furthermore, he introduces new classifications of organizations as structural
forms and power processes, which can be subdivided into seven types of
configurations and described by basic characteristics. Here, organizations are
equated with configurations. The differentiation of configurations are
presented as
* entrepreneurial organization,
* machine organization,
* organization of professionals,
* diversified organization,
* innovative organizations,
* missionary organizations and
* political organizations.

Furthermore, he supplements the configuration with the concept of form, which
can be characterized as a force property in organizations and integrates it
into a life cycle model. Finally, he proposes control mechanisms for
organizations in society to prevent power concentration and presents a
critique towards the formation of society through the construction of
organizations and their characteristics.
