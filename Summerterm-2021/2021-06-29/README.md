## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management
* __Presenter:__ Stefan Grote

## Abstract

Frederick Winslow Taylor's book "The Principles of Scientific Management"
(1911) was one of the first publications about systematic organisational
measures to increase productivity.

Taylors four principles of scientific management are:

(1) Find the “one-best-way” to do something.

(2) Train the workers to do that exact method over and over again.

(3) Supervise and check the work using different methods.

(4) Management's responsibility for the appropriateness of the measures.

The rules apply only to a specifically organised mass production and are on
the threshold of the transition to assembly line production with "scientific
organisation" and extensive dissection of work processes.

They appear historically as both a reaction to group dynamic processes in the
workforce itself to resist high workload and a form of contradiction between
blue collar and white collar workers in the workforce itself.

## Notes



##  From the Chat

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- Why is this called "scientific management"? Which concept of "science" does
  it reference?
  - Kleemann : It refers in a pseudo-scientific way to
    physiological-psychological theories of mental processes developed at that
    time (end of 19th century) mainly in Germany (Wundt and others), that were
    taught in the upcoming American universities at that time.
  - Gräbe: It uses the reputation of "science" in the rapidly growing area of
    technology at that time. In this sense, it is a matter of transferring a
    conceptual system that has been successfully developed in the technical
    field to contexts later referred to as sociological.
  - Kleemann : [Alexei Gastev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Gastev):
    Poetry of the Workman's blow appeared in 1918 in the USSR - and does the
    same scientific "management theory and research" to coordinate production
    in the Soviet Union in the twenties and thirties. Gastew's Central
    Institute of Labour worked closely with Pavlov and they also wanted such a
    division of labour to include unskilled workers.
  - Gräbe: Many parallels, but also differences in motivation: "Revolution for
    Gastev meant empowering workers by allowing them to control everyday
    matters related to work-processes."
    ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Gastev)). Note that these
    activities were triggered at that time not by the company owners but by
    skilled workers. There seems to be a strong turning point of
    differentiations in "blue collars" and "white collars" where later on grew
    out the profession of a manager.

- Why is the foreman opposed to the workers in those days? Is the foreman the
  prototype of the later manager?

- Workers as "experts". How did this develop further? See below.

- Management as art, craft, science? Engineering activity? 

- "Work as fast as possible, but not faster". What is the measure of how fast
  a concrete job can be done?

- To what extent does the possibility of high work performance depend on
  production-organisational conditions over which the worker has only limited
  influence?  
  - See the example of
    [Adolf Hennecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hennecke) in the
    early days of the GDR or the reference to the Russian prototype
    [Stakhanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Stakhanov)




- Planning and precise instructions devaluate the worker's experience (and
  ultimately lead to the image of a "trained gorilla" on the assembly line).
  This image of a modern factory is that of a machine that runs well and
  reliably.
  - With devaluation of the worker's experience a feedback loop between
    justified expectations and experienced results is replaced by a one-way
    relation of command and control.

- To what extent is management also subject to "scientific management"?
  - Onle the "workman" is "scientifically managed". 

- Transition from flat wages to piecework wages. What are the economic
  consequences? Role of norming in this concept.

- What categories of "workman" can be distinguished today (besides manager and
  expert)?
