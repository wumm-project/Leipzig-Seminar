## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management
* __Presenter:__ Stefan Grote

## Abstract

Frederick Winslow Taylor's book "The Principles of Scientific Management"
(1911) was one of the first publications about systematic organisational
measures to increase productivity.

Taylors four principles of scientific management are:

(1) Find the “one-best-way” to do something.

(2) Train the workers to do that exact method over and over again.

(3) Supervise and check the work using different methods.

(4) Management's responsibility for the appropriateness of the measures.

The rules apply only to a specifically organised mass production and are on
the threshold of the transition to assembly line production with "scientific
organisation" and extensive dissection of work processes.

They appear historically as both a reaction to group dynamic processes in the
workforce itself to resist high workload and a form of contradiction between
blue collar and white collar workers in the workforce itself.
