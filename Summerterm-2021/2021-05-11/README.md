## Notes

In the seminar it became clear that Ackoff's systems theoretical approaches to
management theory date back to the 1970s and are strongly influenced by the
developments at that time, especially in cybernetics. With the availability of
the first computers at that time, questions of _control theory_ were newly
discussed, which in the pre-computer age could often only be solved by
filigree mechanical constructions such as the pressure regulator on steam
engines, the clock pendulum, etc. The computer opened up completely new
dimensions of management and control through data collected and processed at
the right time, even though technology at that time was still far from being
able to realise the mature theoretical concepts that had already been
conceived. The roots also reach far back into the first decades of the 20th
century to the beginnings of _assembly line_ production, the associated
standardisation of operating procedures and the possibilities and realisation
of a parallel emerging _automation technology_.  In the cybernetics wave of
the 1960s, practical applications of control circuits in various domains
played an important role, right up to the ["skilled worker for BMSR
technology"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facharbeiter_f%C3%BCr_BMSR-Technik)
as a newly emerging profession in the GDR economy. So much about the
background of Ackoff's theoretical approaches. See also (Steinbuch 1966),
(Steinbuch 1971) or (Prigogine/Stengers 1981).

It is interesting to note the extensive convergence of Ackoff's concept of
system with those introduced earlier, but also their differences. Ackoff, too,
sees the constitutive property of a system in the interaction of its
components and the emergent functionality resulting from it. This phenomenon,
which is also called _synergy_, leads from concurrency and, in the worst case,
opposition of the components to a cooperation. In contrast to TRIZ, where the
creation of such a cooperation is a constructive engineering achievement,
Ackoff takes up the idea with the concepts of organismic and social systems
that such _synergetic_ or _symbiotic_ (as a higher form of synergy)
structuring phenomena also occur "spontaneously" and without "constructive"
intention under natural-biological (organismic) or socio-cultural conditions
of humans' co-operate actions. In the field of management, especially
systematic management, the idea then arises to influence such "natural"
processes also in _socio-economic systems_, namely in _organisations_, in
order to push them in a certain direction through active management action
(ultimately in a technical understanding of "social engineering").

An essential contradiction arose from the attempt to gain influence on
systemic processes with such individual management action, the emergent
character of which had just been postulated, i.e. which precisely does _not_
develop from the influence of one component alone, even if it is at the top of
a management hierarchy and concentrates great decision-making powers in its
hands.

### "A whole cannot be divided into independent parts." (Ackoff)

However, this is exactly what is done in system's analysis - first _structural
analysis_ and then _procedural analysis_ are performed, the analysis of the
interaction of the parts. These contradictory views are present both in the
system concept of the lecture and in Shchedrovitsky's argumentation [MSM,
p. 61 cont.]. Shchedrovitsky further asks (p. 58) what is the significance of
a "human component" in such a system (i.e. in an organisation), which on the
one hand is a "cog in the system" (ibid.) when it is about functioning of the
system as a unit, while on the other hand the organisation as a "living
organisation" has an "informal structure" (ibid.). Shchedrovitsky goes on to
ask what it means for a "manager" component to be an element of _two_
subsystems of the organisation and thus of the system as a whole, on the one
hand in the management circle of the company and on the other hand as the head
of his own department (p. 61). Is this manager then not rather the _link_, the
"transmission rod" (ibid.) between these two subsystems?

Is Ackoff's thesis therefore self-contradictory? Is the answer to the question
"Can a system be broken down into parts?" therefore perhaps "No, but we have
no choice but to try it if we want better to understand the system"?

In particular, what does this mean for another Ackoff thesis like "if each
part is managed well, the whole will be."? For M. Rubin, not only analysis and
synthesis play a role here. Both have to be complemented by _evaluation_, in
which the _justified expectations_ that have arisen from a system description
are compared with the _experienced results_, which closes the circle of
knowledge to an evolving dynamic that is confronted with a reality that is
also evolving.

### Mechanical, Organismic and Social Systems

We had already analysed this subdivision in more detail a year ago in the
seminar, see [Graebe/Kleemann 2020], and exposed the roots of such a
subdivision in the history of ideas. Briefly speaking, they consist in the
fact that for 400 years, with the gradual transition from scholasticism to an
experimentally based understanding of science, the successes of an initially
mechanically based technology became the basis of generalised scientific world
views. Attempts to explain biological phenomena mechanistically quickly came
up against limitations. The first major critique of such explanations is
certainly Offray's "man a machine" [Offray], even though such explanatory
approaches are still widely used today, not least in certain explanatory
approaches in the Human Brain Project or in the field of AI, when their
mechanical constructs are now finally supposed to obtain a "divine spark" of
intelligence breathed into them thanks to advances in computer technology.

Criticism led as early as in the 18th century to the demarcation of
(technologically accessible) _mechanical_ systems from (technologically
inaccessible) _organismic_ ones.  With the further development of chemistry
(from phlogiston to modern analytical methods, which would not have been
possible without the developments of physics and precision mechanical
technologies based on it) and biology (from a theory of the development of
species according to Darwin and Haeckel to modern molecular genetic methods,
which in turn would not have been possible without those scientific and
technological developments in chemistry), lines of tradition have shifted
here, but the qualitative picture has not changed.

The concept of _social systems_ in its diversity as socio-technical,
socio-economic, socio-cultural and socio-ecological systems is, however, new
and relatively recent in this phalanx of broader reflection, although already
clearly articulated and developed in a relatively strong materialist reading
in Hegel, Feuerbach and Marx. Its breakthrough is also linked to the
cybernetics debate of the 1960s and more complex approaches to control
circuits, which have since been investigated in greater mathematical detail.
The extremely complicated forms of progression of systems discovered in that
research process (up to the "strange attractors" discussed in the lecture),
systems, which can be described deterministically by simple differential
equations, show that classical mechanistic approaches can only be exploited to
adequately describe a very small section of reality. These argumentations and
insights appeared in political writings such as the Club of Rome's 1972
writing "Limits to Growth" or the demand for a "new political thinking"
(Gorbachev 1987), but also in demands for new traditions of thinking in
science as a transition "from the materialistic-mechanistic worldview to a
mental-vital cosmos" (Potsdam Manifesto 2005, there also the demand "We have
to learn to think in a new way.“ It goes back to the politically founded
Einstein-Russell Manifesto 1955) up to approaches of an open culture (open
source, software ecosystems, energy ecosystems, models of distributed
autonomous agents, etc.). It remains to be explored which qualitatively new
approaches are hidden behind such images.

##  From the Chat

- Kleemann : For the discussion:
  - First, the problem of transferring biological categories to system
    considerations.
    - This was not further discussed.
  - Secondly, the problem of purpose itself: evolution is not optimisation.
    - Optimisation is a process within a static environment. It is hard to
      apply that idea in system's research, but possible in situations where
      it is a justified expectation that (for the special purposes of
      description) the context can be considered to be static.      
  - Thirdly, pattern formation in chaotic systems as non-goal-directed
    developments.

- Kleemann : does such a management lead to a rather pyramidal hierarchy?

- Veronika Heuten : Can we talk again about open and closed systems? Why is an
  organic system open?
  - Together with Shchedrovitsky's thesis "Only systems in motion can be
    managed" there are no closed systems - any system requires a throughput of
    energy and matter (and possibly information) to keep its forms of motion
    running and only motion leads to selfreprodution of structures of the
    system. Even a car has to be refueled and must be maintained regularly.
    Considering a system as closed is nevertheless a means of abstraction in
    the process of "reduction to the essentials" in the mode of system's
    description.
  - Daniel Werner : Analogous to thermodynamics: Just as a perpetuum mobile
    (closed system without energy exchange with the environment) is impossible
    to realise, according to Shchedrowitsky, management without movement is
    also impossible.

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- Is there a "holistic approach" or is every "holistic" approach also
  reductionist?

- "The brain" - works like that in all cases (hearing, seeing ...), but does
  that have anything to do with a _systemic approach_ or rather with _context
  embedding_?  Or are they synonymous?

- Ackoff's concept of system is largely the same as TRIZ's, but he looks "from
  the inside out", while TRIZ (and engineers) look "from the outside in"?

- Shchedrovitsky distinguishes "constructed" systems and "living" systems, but
  his approach is different - as soon as a constructed system is put into
  operation, then it turns into a living system, and the system parameters, up
  to and including the "purpose" (Ackoff), change.

- Definition of "management" - how does this fit with Shchedrovitsky's
  approach? Especially his sentence "You can only manage something that is in
  motion". 

- View of (entrepreneurial) system as "mechanical", "organismic", "social"
  runs parallel to the unfolding of both technology and capitalist forms of
  enterprise.  What are the causal connections?  What was first "thinking
  organismically" or "creating stock corporations"? And how is the turn to
  "social" to be understood? New socio-economic forms? Is this driven by the
  (also investive) demands of technology?

- How are the concepts "enterprise as a social system", "technical ecosystems"
  and the increasingly important concept of "socio-ecological systems" related
  to each other?

- What does the (by Ackoff) higher valued state intervention mean under these
  new conditions of production?  This is in complete contradiction to
  neoliberal approaches that were dominant for 40 years after Ackoff's (1972)
  writings.

- Analysis - Synthesis. With M. Rubin: analysis - synthesis - evaluation as a
  triangle.  Rubin sees this as a cycle A -> S -> E -> A ... However, analysis
  and synthesis are understood differently there, not analysis = from the
  whole to the parts, synthesis = from the parts to the whole, but in both
  cases it is about _the same_ system.

- Kleemann : that's ok: purpose as cooperative organisational interaction.
  - We discussed where "purpose" comes from (purpose as the reason why a
    system exists).

- Daniel Werner : So Ackoff or the theory (from the 1970s) is only a child of
  his time. At that time Darwinism was still a contemporary view of evolution.
  - We discussed the notion of evolution.
  - Kleemann : clearly no reproach in this sense. Yes it is a child of its
    time, but today we know that biological reproduction is no unfolding of
    blueprints, but adaptation, selection, mutation; organism does not develop
    in environment, but reciprocally; accordingly chaotic movement and
    nevertheless pattern formation are not linear, therefore other conception
    of system (submersive vs. immersive system notion as explained in the
    lecture) are needed, and other management methods - flexible, mobile and
    flat hierarchicies.
  - Kleemann : Dennett once said it nicely: the classical conception is a
    trickle down, evolution and chaos theory are bubbling up.

- There was a discussion about the relation of "social systems" and "public
  ownership". It deserves further discussion what it means for a society which
  is founded on private ownership to unfold cooperative action. Questions of
  the divergence of ownership and management functions must be considered
  here, as well as supra-personal legal forms of ownership (§§ 21 cont. BGB).
   - Graebe, Hans-Gert : What is "public ownership"?
   - Graebe, Hans-Gert : Who makes decisions in companies? Management or
     owners?     
     - It is an illusion to argue that one can influence corporate policy with
       less than 1% of the shares via the shareholders' meeting. That such
       influence is possible at all contradicts the postulated emergent
       property of the primary system function. In this understanding,
       influence can only be exercised through a symbiotic relationship with
       the system as a whole. Management cannot be conceptualized in a cheaper
       way, at least based on the understanding of a system developed so far
       in the seminar.
