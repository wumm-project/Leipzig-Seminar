##  From the Chat

- Kleemann : For the discussion: First, the problem of transferring biological
  categories to system considerations. Secondly, the problem of purpose
  itself: evolution is not optimisation. Thirdly, pattern formation in chaotic
  systems as non-goal-directed developments.

- Kleemann : does such a management lead to a rather pyramidal hierarchy?

- Veronika Heuten : Can we talk again about open and closed systems? Why is an
  organic system open?

Graebe, Hans-Gert :

- Is there a "holistic approach" or is every "holistic" approach also
  reductionist?

- "The brain" - works like that in all cases (hearing, seeing ...), but does
  that have anything to do with a systemic approach or rather with context
  embedding?  Or are they synonymous?

- Ackoff's concept of system is largely the same as TRIZ's, but he looks "from
  the inside out", while TRIZ (and engineers) look "from the outside in"?

- Are there "closed" mechanical systems? The car also has to be refuelled
  again and again, once a year go for a check-up, etc.

- Shchedrovitsky distinguishes "constructed" systems and "living" systems, but
  his approach is different - as soon as a constructed system is put into
  operation, then it turns into a living system, and the system parameters, up
  to and including the "purpose" (Ackoff), change.

- Definition of "management" - how does this fit with Shchedrovitsky's
  approach? Especially his sentence "You can only manage something that is in
  motion". He also discusses a "car example".

- View of (entrepreneurial) system as "mechanical", "organismic", "social"
  runs parallel to the unfolding of both technology and capitalist forms of
  enterprise.  What are the causal connections?  "Thinking organismically" ->
  "creating stock corporation" or vice versa? And how is the turn to "social"
  to be understood? New socio-economic forms? Is this driven by the (also
  investive) demands of technology?

- How are the concepts "enterprise as a social system", "technical ecosystems"
  and the increasingly important concept of "socio-ecological systems" related
  to each other?

- What does the (by Ackoff) higher valued state intervention mean under these
  new conditions of production?  This is in complete contradiction to
  neoliberal approaches that were dominant for 40 years. Ackoff (1972) - the
  40 years of neoliberalism came afterwards.

- Analysis - Synthesis. With M. Rubin: analysis - synthesis - evaluation as a
  triangle.  Rubin sees this as a cycle A -> S -> E -> A ...

- However, analysis and synthesis are understood differently there, not
  analysis = from the whole to the parts, synthesis = from the parts to the
  whole, but in both cases it is about _the same_ system.

- Dissoultion = that which constitutes the contradiction approach of TRIZ.  It
  is about a solution of contradictons that is "better than the optimum" ever
  can be, namely beyond the "Pareto boundary".

- Daniel Werner : Analogous to thermodynamics: Just as a perpetuum mobile
  (closed system without energy exchange with the environment) is impossible
  to realise, according to Shchedrowitsky, management without movement is also
  impossible.

- Kleemann : that's ok: purpose as cooperative organisational interaction. 

- Daniel Werner : So Ackoff or the theory (from the 1970s) is only a child of
  his time. At that time Darwinism was still a contemporary view of evolution.

- Kleemann : clearly no reproach in this sense. Yes it is a child of its time,
  but today we know that biological reproduction is no unfolding of
  blueprints, but adaptation, selection, mutation; organism does not develop
  in environment, but reciprocally; accordingly chaotic movement and
  nevertheless pattern formation are not linear, therefore other conception of
  system (submersive vs. immersive system notion) are needed, and other
  management methods -- flexible, mobile and flat hierarchicies.

- Kleemann : Dennett once said it nicely: the classical conception is a
  trickle down, evolution and chaos theory are bubbling up.

- Graebe, Hans-Gert : What is "public ownership"?

- Graebe, Hans-Gert : Who makes decisions in companies? Management or owners?
