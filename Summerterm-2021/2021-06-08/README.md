## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Goal-Models and the i* Modelling Method
* __Presenter:__ Marie Windhorst

## Abstract

One problem with goals is, that often they are not expressed directly, but
more often indirect or informally. A possible approach to identify goals is to
analyze the current system and use it as a source to identify goals. Having a
closer look a the current state of the system might end up in a list of
problems, and simply turning the problems around can provide in a list of
goals to be achieved for the system-to-be.

There are several modelling languages that help to analyze, conceptualize and
model the requirements of a system to be developed or transformed. Some of the
well known goal oriented modelling languages are KAOS and i*. The modelling
language i* (pronounced iStar) was developed by Yu. It is based on the goal
modelling approach, but takes it as a starting point for an agent-oriented
modelling language.
