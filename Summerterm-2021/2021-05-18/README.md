## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  MBO &ndash; Management by Objectives
* __Presenter:__ Franziska GÃ¶rg

## Abstract

Due to the increasing complexity of markets, structures and processes, new
management methods have been developed in the 20th century.  _Management
principles_ serve to maintain a uniform line in the management of employees.
Among these, "management-by" techniques exist, such as the "management by
objectives" (MBO) management tool.

By setting principles for management behavior, it is possible to systematize
corporate management and ensure a way of controlling corporate processes while
at the same time meeting the expectations of the company and its employees.

In the strategic management model "Management by Objectives" developed by
Peter F. Drucker in the 1950s, the focus is on the cooperative development and
agreement of objectives by the manager and the employees in order to improve
the performance of the organization.

##  From the Chat

Graebe, Hans-Gert:

- New image of man. What is the connection to technological developments,
  especially cybernetics?

- Generality of self-control and self-initiative - does this mean that every
  employee becomes a manager?
  - Jannis de Riz : At this point I would refer to the management definition
    on the German Wikipedia page, according to which every employee would also
    be a manager.

- Slide 3: What is the connection between management, formal organisation and
  resources?

- Analysis: target-actual state, planning. Where do the target expectations
  come from?

- Management body: Shchedrovitsky addresses the contradiction between the
  subsystem of the management body and the subsystem in which the manager is
  the boss.

- 5 steps MBO model: Analysis and evaluation occur, but not synthesis.
  Ackoff: A - S without E, Rubin: A -> S -> E -> A ...

- Slide 9: How does _goal setting_ work against the _requirements_ associated
  with the place. What is the concept of place vs. staffing (as it is central
  in the _role concept_ of computer science)? How to ensure that suitable
  resources are available at the right time to fill the place (the concept of
  role can easily be extended to all possible resources).

- Slide 11: Structuring the actions according to a phase model, as we have
  come to know it in process models such as CMMI or the process model of ISO
  9000, does not play a role here? But SMART does go in this direction? Action
  is what is called "activity" today? But milestones have a clearly different
  meaning today.  "Action" as a self-similar structuring unit of business
  processes?

- Slide 16: How should I imagine this - boss and subordinate communicating "at
  equals", especially in contradictory constellations? Or are there no
  contradictions in the whole system?

- Slide 18: Is "the goal was achieved" also negotiated between boss and
  subordinate "at equals"?

- How does the approach deal with the resource problem? In a systemic
  approach, the resource throughput - the time-critical provision of the
  "throughput" - is one of the central variables that can be influenced by the
  system itself only to a limited extent. The throughput must be guaranteed by
  the supersystem.

- Slide 21: CMMI knows "key practices" and "key process areas" to focus on the
  improvement of capability and maturity. Maturity seems to play no role at
  all in MBO?

- Slide 22: Clear connection to SCRUM. However, SCRUM works on a much
  different basis.

- Slide 23: OKR, how do you secure the "old values" of planning, management,
  control within the "new values" flexibility, creativity, collaboration?

More comments:

- Daniel Werner : Slide 9: Are the "stable factors" really that stable once the
  activities have been assigned?
  - Aren't characteristics such as motivation even more dependent on daily
    form than, for example, qualification, as soon as the respective
    activities have been assigned to an employee?

- Veronika Heuten : There are different types of incentives that work
  extrinsically or intrinsically. So I wouldn't call these two methods two
  different poles.

- Daniel Werner : So Milestone is a subset of Activity and Activity is a
  subset of Actions?
