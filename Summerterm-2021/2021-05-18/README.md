## Abstract

Due to the increasing complexity of markets, structures and processes, new
management methods have been developed in the 20th century.  _Management
principles_ serve to maintain a uniform line in the management of employees.
Among these, "management-by" techniques exist, such as the "management by
objectives" (MBO) management tool.

By setting principles for management behavior, it is possible to systematize
corporate management and ensure a way of controlling corporate processes while
at the same time meeting the expectations of the company and its employees.

In the strategic management model "Management by Objectives" developed by
Peter F. Drucker in the 1950s, the focus is on the cooperative development and
agreement of objectives by the manager and the employees in order to improve
the performance of the organization.
